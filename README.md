## Introduction

If you're passionate about robotics and eager to dive into hands-on hardware and ROS2 projects, this course is perfect for you. We'll guide you step-by-step in building a fully functional robot using the ESP32 and MicroROS with ROS2 over Wifi.

### Course Overview

**Section 1: Building the Robot**
- Assemble your robot from the ground up
- Utilize 3D-printed parts and resources we provide
- Learn about electronic connections and power distribution

## How to Run

1. **Assemble the Robot**: Follow the instructions provided in the `resources` directory. Use the 3D models and the circuit design to assemble your robot.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) in your preferred IDE (e.g., VSCode).
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Open the project folder in your IDE.

3. **Program the Robot**:
   - Navigate to the `microROS_bot` directory.
   - Modify the `src/main.cpp` file as needed to customize the robot's behavior.
   - Use PlatformIO to build and upload the code to your ESP32.

4. **Integrate MicroROS**:
   - Ensure you have ROS2 installed on your computer.
   - Follow the instructions in the `lib/ros_communication` directory to integrate MicroROS with your ESP32 robot.
